# To-Do-Application
To-Do List Web Application

This task was given to me for the HackerEarth FrontEnd Internship.

Create a to-do list web app. (Please refer to Image 1)
Design details and how the app should work:-

  - There are basically two panes - one is to-do pane and the other is completed tasks pane.
  - To-do pane can contain utmost two tasks per row. Total no. of tasks can be unlimited.
  - Color of each uncompleted task is randomly chosen from a set of colors.
  - When a task is completed, user will move it to the completed list(right pane) by drag and drop only.
  - If a user wish to delete a task, he/she can do it by clicking cross button on top right corner of that task. You can see that in design, too.
  - You have to make sure the to-do list persists even after the page is refreshed.
  - You are free to add any additional features or improve upon the design.
